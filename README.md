### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Haessler, but everybody calls me Haess (like the avocado).

I am a network engineer who decided to switch to a career in software development.

During the 7 years prior to this transition in my career I have worked on projects that involved mission critical systems, the exposure to these high-paced environments allowed me to develop effective communication to collaborate with other teams and also problem solving skills as a member of tier 3 support teams.

When I'm not coding, I pass the time by playing piano and studying Portuguese.
