### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Haess!

As a Software Engineer, I specialize in Ruby on Rails, building scalable and high-performance systems. My work involves designing real-time features, optimizing backend processes, and leveraging DevOps best practices to ensure reliability and maintainability.

Beyond my full-time role, I enjoy taking on personal projects that push my creativity, challenge my skills, and allow me to explore new technologies and business models.

What I Bring to the Table:
âœ… Code Craftsmanship â€“ Writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code
âœ… Backend Performance & Architecture â€“ Focused on optimization and scalability
âœ… Collaborative Spirit â€“ A strong believer in teamwork and feedback
âœ… Lifelong Learner â€“ Always open to new tech and improving my craft

Currently, Iâ€™m based in Spain under a digital nomad visa and always open to exciting opportunities, especially those that align with my skills and long-term growth. I enjoy working on challenging projects and collaborating with talented teamsâ€”letâ€™s connect!
